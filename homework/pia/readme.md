=====================
In my pia project I will present a program in which you can find out if you could have covid or not.

**Objetive**
The objective of this program is to facilitate the early detection of covid so that it does not aggravate, apart from the contingency in any exit from home you could infect yourself and with this test you may have a rough idea of whether or not you have the disease without leaving home and infecting others or being infected.

**What can this program do?**
                
1. First the program would ask you your name, age, weight and height and if you have any chronic diseases;this is relevant because here we can know if you have more risk factors than the general population. With your weight and height we can know your bmies in the case that you donnot know how to obtain it, with this data we can warn you if you suffer from obesity, overweight or low weight because these are covid risk factors. With your age we will give you a notice of global citation depending on the age ranges for example: people from 21 to 50 are the most infected and the ones with the most irrigation are people over 60 years old.

2. Subsequently, a chronic disease count is done as these are a risk factor as well, and finally a covid symptom count is made that the user presents.

3. The user will be asked to enter the points obtained to finally generate a result, in this case it is to know if the user is positive or negative covid.
 
4. Finally, if the users whats to know the result of other person thay can because the program will ask if they want to close the program or run it again.

REPORT
~~~~~~~~
The first thing I did was look for how to make a repetitive structure because I get very scrambled and did not know how to start it, use the Joaquin10 video where it explains how after running your program what you are going to do is ask the user if you want to close the program or run it again. 
What I did was use a similar structure to ask the user if he were ready to start the test and already after running the entire program would be asked if he wanted to finish or perform the cycle again. When you ask the question and get an affirmative answer, you proceed to display the instructions and a section of data that must be entered for storage and use later, also use a structure for all the data to be directly related to the user.
In Kevin Korduner's video presents us with a data warehouse for a student x where the grades of his subjects are obtained, what I did was do something similar only that the user does one user per round and does not make a simple data entry but from the data previously entered messages are displayed depending on the ranges that apply. 
The messages came out depending on whether you had any of the risk factors, for example if your age was between 21 and 50 years old you entered the infection category and if you had more than 60 it was already an alert because they are the most vulnerable; for this use if the condition was met I would display a message that would alert the user that he has a risk factor, I also did something similar with weight but here I needed the height data also so that I could obtain the BMIES so that I could know if the person was overweight, obese or underweight that are also factors, guide me in the ATS Programming video for the structure and also guide me by EDUARDO HERNANDEZ to take out the BMIES.
After taking all this data the user was asked to say that chronic diseases he suffered and also what symptoms of covid he presented and in these two parts use a counter, use the Index video reference where he uses a digit counter where you enter a certain number of numbers and tells you how many are, apply it to keep a count of "covid points" so that you can then know if the user was positive covid or not.
Finally, the user is asked how many points he obtained in the two counts and then be added and thus reach the result, use the latincoder video reference where only a sum makes, it seems that it is not something to reference but I did not know the truth or add, this project helped me to strengthen knowledge and acquire many new ones.
After counting if the user had more than 9 points then he was positive covid and was told, if he was otherwise minor then a negative message appeared to him. At the end of the respective message the user is asked again if they want to re-test or exit, if the answer is if then the program is run again, if the farewell is not simply shown and the program ends.
